Thanks for downloading my skin or remodel!

How to install:

Extract the contents of the zip file (or the contents of Main Mod and Addon folders) to your World of Tanks res_mods directory (Example: C:\World of Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.1.1\).

If the skin incldues any addons that you wis to install extract them to the same location AFTER installing the main mod.

Hope you enjoy!
